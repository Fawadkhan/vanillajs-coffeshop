# Vanilla JS Single Page Application (SPA) Learning Project

This project represents my attempt to build a single-page application (SPA) using Vanilla JavaScript. It's part of my journey to understand the intricacies of frontend development without relying on frameworks or libraries.

## Credits

This project is inspired by and follows the teachings from a course by Maximiliano Firtman on [Frontendmasters](https://frontendmasters.com/). His expertise in the field has been invaluable to my learning process.

## Steps to Install

To run this project locally, you need to set up a live server. This can easily be done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the Live Server extension. Follow these steps:

1. **Install VS Code**: If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Live Server Extension**: Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`. Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey and install it.

3. **Run Live Server**: Open your project folder in VS Code, right-click on your `index.html` file in the Explorer view, and select "Open with Live Server". This will launch your application in your default web browser.

4. **View Your Application**: The Live Server extension will automatically open a new tab in your default web browser where you can view your application running. Any changes you make to your files will automatically refresh the page.

Enjoy developing your Vanilla JS SPA!
